- ✅ Cabinet types selected
- ✅ Number of intersections
- ✅ Equipment quantities (Nexus, sensors, etc.)
- ✅ Auxiliary equipment quantities
- ✅ Timeline preference
- ✅ Submission timestamp

### 3. Installation Registrations (`/register-install`)
When customers register an install, you get:
- ✅ Agency name
- ✅ Distributor name
- ✅ Intersection names
- ✅ Estimated install date
- ✅ Cabinet types
- ✅ Signal phasing files
- ✅ Signal timing files
- ✅ Contact information (name, email, phone)
- ✅ Status tracking
- ✅ Submission timestamp

4. **Enable audit logging** (who viewed/changed what)
5. **Set up email alerts** for new submissions

### Quick Auth Setup (Optional):
We've included NextAuth in the project. To enable:
